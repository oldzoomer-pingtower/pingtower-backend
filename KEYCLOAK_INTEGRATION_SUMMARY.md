## Current Architecture

The backend now consists of the following microservices:

- **pinger** - Service for system availability checking (http://localhost:8081)
- **notificator** - Service for managing notifications (http://localhost:8082)
- **statistics** - Service for statistics and data aggregation (http://localhost:8084)
- **common** - Shared library module with common components
- **keycloak** - Authentication and authorization service (http://localhost:8080)

## Verification

All services are currently running and healthy:
- Keycloak: UP (http://localhost:8080)
- Pinger: UP (http://localhost:8081)
- Notificator: UP (http://localhost:8082)
- Statistics: UP (http://localhost:8084)

## Next Steps

To fully utilize the Keycloak integration:

1. Access the Keycloak admin console at http://localhost:8080/admin
2. Log in with the default credentials (admin/admin)
3. Configure additional users and roles as needed
4. Update client applications to use Keycloak for authentication
5. For external access:
   - Set the DOMAIN environment variable in your .env file
   - Access Keycloak at http://your-domain:8080
   - Use the pingtower-frontend client for web/mobile applications
